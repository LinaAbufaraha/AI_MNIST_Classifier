Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 

AlexNet classified it as a Cocker Spaniel, English Cocker Spaniel, or Cocker Spaniel. ResNet and VGG classified it as a Golden Retriever.

There is a classification difference between AlexNet and other VGG and ResNet models.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 

No, there were differences.

AlexNet classified both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as Cocker Spaniel, English Cocker Spaniel, or Cocker.
ResNet classified both as Golden Retriever.

VGG was the only model that assigned different breeds to Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg. It classified Dog_01.jpg as a Golden Retriever but classified Dog_02.jpg as a Chihuahua


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 

Yes, Despite differences in classification, all three models correctly identified the non-dog images.

Table_01.jpg: Classified as Desk (AlexNet & VGG) and Folding Chair (ResNet).
Rare_Cats_01.jpg: Classified as Arctic Fox (AlexNet & ResNet) and Siamese Cat (VGG).


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:

ResNet performed the best as it correctly identified all dogs and non-dogs while providing consistent breed classifications.
